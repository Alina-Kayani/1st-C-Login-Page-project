First Semester C++ Projects
This repository contains my initial projects developed during the first semester of my software engineering studies. These projects focus on foundational C++ programming skills, covering concepts like file handling, user input/output, and basic logic implementation. Each project is a small application designed to practice and demonstrate key C++ skills, preparing me for more advanced programming challenges.
